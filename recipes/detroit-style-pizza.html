        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> 
                Detroit-style pizza is often referred to as a deep-dish 
                pizza. It is extremely crunchy, crispy, and contains 
                cheese-laden slices. The prep time for this recipe is about 
                25 minutes and it has a cook time of 15 minutes. However, 
                in order to let your dough rise, it will take an additional
                1 hour and 5 minutes. This totals to about 1 hour and 45 minutes.
