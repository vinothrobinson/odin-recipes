        <h2> Description </h2>
            <p> 
                Detroit-style pizza is often referred to as a deep-dish 
                pizza. It is extremely crunchy, crispy, and contains 
                cheese-laden slices. The prep time for this recipe is about 
                25 minutes and it has a cook time of 15 minutes. However, 
                in order to let your dough rise, it will take an additional
                1 hour and 5 minutes. This totals to about 1 hour and 45 minutes.

                <h3> Sauce Ingredients </h3>

                    <li> 2 teaspoons dried oregano </li>
                    <li> 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>
                    <li> 1 teaspoon garlic powder </li>
                <h3> Toppings </h3>
                    <li> 8 ounces Monterey Jack cheese </li>
                    <li> 4 ounces mild Cheddar cheese </li>
                    <li> 1 (8 ounce) package thick pepperoni slices </li>       
            </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Start the dough: Pour water into the bowl of a 
                    stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment. 
                    Stir in yeast and sugar and let dissolve. Add bread flour, 
                    2 teaspoons oil, and salt; knead until dough is very smooth, 
                    soft, and elastic.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Drizzle remaining 1 teaspoon oil onto a 10x14-inch Detroit-style 
                    pizza pan; use your fingers to spread oil over the bottom of the 
                    pan. Place dough in the center of the pan. Oil your fingers, then 
                    pull and stretch dough into a rectangular shape. Cover and let 
                    rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, make the sauce: Bring marinara sauce, oregano, red pepper 
                    flakes, and garlic powder to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-low 
                    heat. Simmer for 15 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven to 525 degrees F (274 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Prepare the toppings: Dice Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheese into small 
                    cubes. Combine in a bowl and toss to mix. Set out pepperoni slices.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Finish the dough: Rub fingertips with some olive oil from the pan. Press 
                    out air from the dough while stretching and pushing it into a rectangle 
                    that goes all the way to the edges of the pan. Stretch dough up the sides 
                    about 1/2 inch or so.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Lay almost all pepperoni slices onto dough. Scatter cheese cubes evenly over 
                    top, making sure to fully cover all the edges where dough meets the pan. 
                    Ladle sauce on top in three long strips. Arrange remaining pepperoni slices 
                    over top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until pizza is a bit darker than golden brown, 
                    about 15 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Very carefully slide pizza onto a cutting board. Slice into 9 rectangular pieces.
                </li>
