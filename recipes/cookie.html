                <li> ½ teaspoon baking soda </li>
                <li> ½ teaspoon salt </li>
                <li> 1 cup packed brown sugar </li>
                <li> ¾ cup unsalted butter, melted </li>
                <li> ½ cup white sugar </li>
                <li> 1 egg </li>
                <li> 1 egg yolk </li>
                <li> 1 tablespoon vanilla extract </li>
                <li> 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips </li>
            </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol> 
                <li> 
                    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). 
                    Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.
                </li>
                <li> 
                    Sift flour, baking soda, and salt together; set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Beat brown sugar, melted butter, and white sugar with 
                    an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat 
                    in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla until light and creamy; 
                    add flour mixture and stir until dough is just combined. 
                    Stir in chocolate chips.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drop spoonfuls of dough 3 inches apart onto the prepared 
                    baking sheets.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until edges are golden, about 
                    15 to 17 minutes. Cool on the cookie sheets briefly before 
                    transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.
                </li>
            </ol>
