        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
            <ul> 
                <li> 1 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li> 3 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
                <li> 1 tablespoon white sugar </li>
                <li> ¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste </li>
                <li> 1 ¼ cups milk </li>
                <li> 3 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
                <li> 1 egg </li>
            </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> 
                    Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl. 
                    Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix 
                    until smooth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or 
                    scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for 
                    each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 
                    2 to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. 
                    Repeat with remaining batter.
